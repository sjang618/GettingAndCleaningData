Data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


This assignment includes the following files:

- 'README.txt': analysis of the code of run_analysis..R

- 'CodeBook.md': Codebook that containes information about the study design and variables.

- 'run_analyis.R': R code scripts that was run on the data set.

Instructions

1. Download the data set, https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Unzip the data set into working directory. Folder named UCI HAR Dataset will be created.

3. Load RStudio and run the R script named run_analysis.R. This R script fulfills the following requirements:
	1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

	2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	
	3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
	
	4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	
	5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

4. Output data set named tidy.txt will be created in the directory.
